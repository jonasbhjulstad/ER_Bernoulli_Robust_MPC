CMake Warning at cmake-build-release/_deps/cppitertools_repo-src/CMakeLists.txt:5 (message):
  The default value of cppitertools_INSTALL_CMAKE_DIR changed recently, from

    "share/cppitertools/cmake"

  to

    "share"

  in order to behave better with existing CMake practice.

  

  In order to get the previous behavior, pass

    -Dcppitertools_INSTALL_CMAKE_DIR=share/cppitertools/cmake

  to the CMake invocation; in order to get the new behavior without the
  warning,

  pass

    -Dcppitertools_INSTALL_CMAKE_DIR=share

  explicitly.
